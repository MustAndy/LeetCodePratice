An overloaded function is a function that shares its name with one or more other functions, but which has a different parameter list. The compiler chooses which function is desired based upon the arguments used.

An overridden function is a method in a descendant class that has a different definition than a virtual function in an ancestor class. The compiler chooses which function is desired based upon the type of the object being used to call the function.

A redefined function is a method in a descendant class that has a different definition than a non-virtual function in an ancestor class. Don't do this. Since the method is not virtual, the compiler chooses which function to call based upon the static type of the object reference rather than the actual type of the object.
