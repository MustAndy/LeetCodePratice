 * Testcase Example:  '[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]'
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing
 * subsequence.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 * Output: 4 
 * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore
 * the length is 4. 
 * 
 * Note: 
 * 
 * 
 * There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to
 * return the length.
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
