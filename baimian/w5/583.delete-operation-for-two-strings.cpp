 * Testcase Example:  '"sea"\n"eat"'
 *
 * 
 * Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required
 * to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one
 * character in either string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: "sea", "eat"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to
 * make "eat" to "ea".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length of given words won't exceed 500.
 * Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.
